#Python_Books.project

-in this project, me and my team mate had to make a web scraper designed to collect 
 information abou books related to a specific topic from an e-commerce site,
 in this case, elefant.ro

-Project purpose : automate the process of data extraction from a book-selling website
 It navigates the website's search page, extracts relevant information about the 
 displayed books and stores them in a JSON file

-Functional details : -this project uses Selenium to access and load the content of the page
		      -pages are loaded in headless mode , enabling the automation process 
                       to run without human interaction
	              -Using BeautifulSoup, the code parses the page content to extract 
		       relevant information from the HTML tags containing book details.
		      -It checks for and skips books marked as "Out of Stock!" to ensure 
			they are not included in the final results.
